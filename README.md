## Welcome to my personal GitHub ðŸ‘‹

Hi all, my name is Lorenzo Decaria. This is my personal GitHub space, where I publicly share my work and personal projects with a dual intent: showcase my skills/knowledge and inspire others to learn from my examples.


## A little bit more about me

- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on a back-end project in TypeScript to create a social media scheduler
- ðŸŒ± My strongest skills are around Swift/SwiftUI and front-end development. This is why I'm currently learning TypeScript and back-end development

My main skills are in Swift and SwiftUI, but I am also comfortable writing code in JavaScript and TypeScript. I have some past experience in C/C++ and Objective-C which I probably just need to brush off on.

When I'm not coding I'm either working out or having quality time with the two women who fill my life with joy: my wife and my daughter.

## Skills
- Programming languages: Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++, Objective-C
- Frameworks: Combine, CoreData, CoreBluetooth, NodeJS, NextJS
- Design patterns: MVC, MVVM-C
- CI/CD: GitHub actions, Bitrise
